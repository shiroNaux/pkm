# Why?
- Programming paradigm là cách phân chia các ngôn ngữ lập trình dựa vào các đặc điểm của chúng
- **The term programming paradigm** refers to **a style of programming**
- It does not refer to a specific language, but rather it refers to the way you program

# Paradigm

```
.
+-- Imperative

## Imperative language

- Imperative programming consists of sets of detailed instructions that are given to the computer to execute in a given order
- Được dựa trên [[Von Neumann architecture]]
- It works by changing the program state through assignment statements
- It performs step by step task by changing state.
- It's called "imperative" because as programmers we dictate exactly what the computer has to do, in a very specific way.
- Các ngôn nhữ trong nhóm này: 
	- COBOL (COmmon Business Oriented Language)
	- FORTRAN ()
	- [[C Programming language|C]]
- Ưu điểm
	- Dễ để implement thuật toán
	- Bao gồm nhiều tính năng như: loop, conditions, variable, ...
- Nhược điểm
	-
