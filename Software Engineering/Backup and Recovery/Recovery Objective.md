RTO stand for recorvery time objectives

RTO is a measure of the maximum amount of time a system, application, or function can be unavailable after a disaster or disruption before the impact on business operations becomes unacceptable. In other words, it represents the target time for restoring normal system operation after an interruption.

### RPO
RPO, on the other hand with RTO, is a measure of the maximum amount of data loss that an organization is willing to accept as a result of a disaster or disruption. It represents the point in time to which data must be recovered from backups in order to minimize the impact of an interruption.
